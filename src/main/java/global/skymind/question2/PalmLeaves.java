/* ===================================================================
 * We will solve a task of classifying palm leaves' conditions.
 * The dataset contains 3 classes (brown spots, healthy and white scale), each with varying number of samples
 * Images are either 350x192 or 192x350, and all are coloured
 *
 * Source: https://www.kaggle.com/hadjerhamaidi/date-palm-data
 * ===================================================================
 * TO-DO
 *
 * 1. Complete the flow of building a dataset iterator
 * 2. Perform feature scaling
 * 3. Complete model configurations according to specifications
 * 4. Train your model
 * 5. Perform model evaluation
 * 6. Save your model
 *
 *
 * ====================================================================
 * Assessment will be based on
 *
 * 1. Correct and complete codes
 * 2. Executable program
 * 3. Convergence of network
 * TOTAL MARKS = 30
 * ====================================================================
 ** NOTE: Only make changes at sections with the following. Replace accordingly.
